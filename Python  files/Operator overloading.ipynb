    "1. Classes can support iteration by defining (or inheriting) __getitem__ or __iter__ .\n",
    "In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use __iter__ first, which returns an object\n",
    "that supports the iteration protocol with a __next__ method: if no __iter__ is found\n",
    "by inheritance search, Python falls back on the __getitem__ indexing method,\n",
    "which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes. If used, the yield\n",
    "statement can create the __next__ method automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- The __str__ and __repr__ methods implement object print displays. The former is\n",
    "called by the print and str built-in functions; the latter is called by print and str\n",
    "if there is no __str__ , and always by the repr built-in, interactive echoes, and nested\n",
    "appearances. That is, __repr__ is used everywhere, except by print and str when\n",
    "a __str__ is defined. A __str__ is usually used for user-friendly displays;\n",
    "__repr__ gives extra details or the object’s as-code form.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Slicing is caught by the __getitem__ indexing method: it is called with a slice object,\n",
    "instead of a simple integer index, and slice objects may be passed on or inspected\n",
    "as needed. In Python 2.X, __getslice__ (defunct in 3.X) may be used for two-limit\n",
    "slices as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.In-place addition tries __iadd__ first, and __add__ with an assignment second. The\n",
    "same pattern holds true for all binary operators. The __radd__ method is also avail-\n",
    "able for right-side addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.When a class naturally matches, or needs to emulate, a built-in type’s interfaces.\n",
    "For example, collections might imitate sequence or mapping interfaces, and call-\n",
    "ables might be coded for use with an API that expects a function. You generally\n",
    "shouldn’t implement expression operators if they don’t naturally map to your ob-\n",
    "jects naturally and logically, though—use normally named methods instead."
